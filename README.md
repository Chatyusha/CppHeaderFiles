## Vector2

### Oprators

    +  Addition ... Vector2 + Vector2 , 
    -  Subtraction ... Vector2 - Vector2 ,
    *  Multiplication ... Vector2 * Vector2 or Vector2 * ConstantNumber ,
    /  Division ... Vector2 / ConstantNumber ,
    == Equal ... Vector2 == Vector2 ,
    != NotEqual ... Vector2 != Vector2 ,
    &= Equal in Size ... Vector2 != Vector2 ,
    <  Less than in Size ... Vector2 < Vector2 ,
    >  Greater than in Size ... Vector2 > Vector2 ,
    <= Less than or Equal in Size ... Vector2 <= Vector2 ,
    >= Greater than or Equal in Size ... Vector2 >= Vector2 

### Functions
